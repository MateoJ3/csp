	<h3>In this game, the participant would be asked several questions about the world until they reached the million-dollar question.
	    <br>
	Every time the user would get a question right, money would be drawn to represent the cash won, but if they lost, the game would finish.</h3>

	<h3>It was an interactive game where the user had to press a series of arrows using the arrow keys.
	    <br>
	The levels get harder and the background changes as the user completes more and more rounds.
	    <br>
	The directions of the arrows were randomized and the sequence would restart if the player made a mistake.</h3>

	<h3>My third project is a tale where our character goes on an adventure and travels through several environments on his horse.
	    <br>
	He then finds a magic wand to take with him and when he encounters a bear, he uses it to turn the animal into a harmless bunny.
	    <br>
	After his fight, he travels back home and rests for the next day.</h3>

	<h3>In this project, we used our knowledge of debugging and phishing to help fix the fish tank monitors.
	    <br>
	Through the assignment, we were able to locate the data breach and how to prevent it in the future.</h3>
