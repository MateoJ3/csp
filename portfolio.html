    <h4>My first project was a game called Who Wants to be a Millionaire.</h4>
    <h4>In this game, the participant would be asked several questions about the world until they reached the million dollar question.</h4>
    <h4>Every time the user would get a question right, money would be drawn to respresent the cash won, but if they lost the game would finish.</h4>
    <h2>1.2.5 Project</h2>

    <h4>My second project was called Arrow Game(We couldn't think of a better name).</h2>
    <h4>It was interactive game where the user had to press a series of arrows using the arrow keys.</h4> 
    <h4>The levels get harder and the background changes as the user completes more and more rounds.</h4>
    <h4>The directions of the arrows were randomized and the sequence would restart if the player made a mistake.</h4>
    <h2>Scratch Project</h2>

    <h4>My third project was a story where our character goes on an adventure and travels through several environments on his horse.</h4>
    <h4>He then finds a magic wand to take with him and when he encounters a bear, he uses it to turn the animal into a harmless bunny.</h4>
    <h4>After his fight, he travels back home and rests for the next day.</h4>
