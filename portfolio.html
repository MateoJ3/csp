    <h3>My first project was a game called Who Wants to be a Millionaire.</h3>
    <h3>In this game, the participant would be asked several questions about the world until they reached the million dollar question.</h3>
    <h3>Every time the user would get a question right, money would be drawn to respresent the cash won, but if they lost the game would finish.</h3>

    <h3>My second project was called Arrow Game(We couldn't think of a better name).</h3>
    <h3>It was interactive game where the user had to press a series of arrows using the arrow keys.</h3> 
    <h3>The levels get harder and the background changes as the user completes more and more rounds.</h3>
    <h3>The directions of the arrows were randomized and the sequence would restart if the user made a mistake.</h3>
